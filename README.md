# toy hashmap

## libs

* so far the only included project is Bob Jenkins's spookyhash but from this github

  https://github.com/k0dai/spookyhash

  the static lib is included along with its licence in ./lib/spookyhash
  I might change it to the basic-one-at-a-time to avoid dependency's on anything
  especially as the spookyhash lib want premake to build form source
